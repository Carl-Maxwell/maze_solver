This is a simple pathfinding project

it is complete as an exercise but not super friendly to use.

to see it in action do

`pry`
`pf = Pathfinder.new( "maze02", [1, 1], [1, 4] )`
`pf.run`

and watch your pf search his way to ultimate victory.

Until your tired of watching, then use ctrl+c to exit out.
